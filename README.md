# About me

Hi there, I'm Can 👋. My background is in molecular biology and life science informatics, with expertise across a range of interdisciplinary research projects. I have actively contributed to a variety of projects, including the analysis of natural substances and their antimicrobial properties, studies on bacterial pathogens responsible for nosocomial infections and their antibiotic resistance, and the investigation of Parkinson's disease cohort landscape. My recent work involves developing a web application to enhance [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)ness of data by showcasing cohort-level statistics without violating [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/) and enabling on-the-fly semantic harmonization.

Currently, I am a research associate at [Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI)](https://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/), in the Department of Bioinformatics. My research focuses on applying language models to support the semi-automatic semantic harmonization of cohort studies. I enjoy turning complex data challenges into useful tools for researchers and working closely with interdisciplinary teams to advance biomedical research.
