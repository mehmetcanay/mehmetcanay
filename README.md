### About me
Hi there, I'm Can üëã. As a research-driven professional, my expertise lies in molecular biology and genetics, and life science informatics. I have actively participated in diverse projects focused on exploring the composition and properties of natural substances, as well as analyzing pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic resistance. Currently, I am a research assistant at [Fraunhofer SCAI](https://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/) at the Department of Bioinformatics. My current research focuses on the automatic semantic harmonization of Parkinson's disease (PD) cohort studies and developing a web application to showcase the PD landscape. With a passion for bioinformatics and a commitment to making meaningful contributions, I aim to drive scientific discoveries and collaborate on innovative research endeavors.
